# Range Calendar

Alpha

## Features

## Preface

The component depends on the [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/index.html) package, which solves a lot of the problems that come with working with dates and times in JavaScript.

We highly recommend reading through the documentation for the package to get a solid feel for how it works, and you'll need to install it in your project to use the date-related components.

## Installation

Install the date package.

Install the component from your command line.

## Anatomy

Import all parts and piece them together.

```vue
<script setup>
import {
  RangeCalendarCell,
  RangeCalendarCellTrigger,
  RangeCalendarGrid,
  RangeCalendarGridBody,
  RangeCalendarGridHead,
  RangeCalendarGridRow,
  RangeCalendarHeadCell,
  RangeCalendarHeader,
  RangeCalendarHeading,
  RangeCalendarNext,
  RangeCalendarPrev,
  RangeCalendarRoot,
} from 'reka-ui'
</script>

<template>
  <RangeCalendarRoot>
    <RangeCalendarHeader>
      <RangeCalendarPrev />
